Function Signature:\n   - The function takes two integer parameters `a` and `b`.\n   - It returns a `nat` (natural number) to ensure the result is always non-negative.\n\n2. Postconditions (ensures clauses):\n   - We specify several important properties of the absolute difference:\n     a. Commutativity: The order of arguments doesn't matter.\n     b. Non-negativity: The result is always greater than or equal to zero.\n     c. Identity: The absolute difference of a number with itself is zero.\n     d. Definition for both cases: When a >= b and when a < b.\n\n3. Implementation:\n   - We use a simple if-else statement to handle both cases (a >= b and a < b).\n   - This approach avoids issues with potential overflow that could occur if we used abs(a - b).\n\n4. Overflow Handling:\n   - The `AbsoluteDifferenceNoOverflow` lemma proves that our implementation correctly handles potential overflow scenarios.\n   - By returning a `nat`, we ensure that even for the maximum possible difference (between min and max int64), the result is correctly represented.\n\n5. Testing:\n   - The `TestAbsoluteDifference` method demonstrates usage and includes assertions to verify correctness for various input scenarios, including edge cases and large integers.\n\nThis implementation satisfies all verification conditions in Dafny, providing a fully verified absolute difference function that works correctly for all possible integer inputs, including handling potential overflow scenarios."}
